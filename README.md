## Sources

The base structure of the project is based on an example from the
[official LSP guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide)
. Some examples were also borrowed from
[this Antlr tutorial](https://tomassetti.me/code-completion-with-antlr4-c3/)
and [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mike-lischke/antlr4-c3).
